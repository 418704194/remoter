A very simple R package to emulate features of the inline package for
Rcpp, but for pbdR.  

This assumes you have MPI and the pbdR utilities installed, but wish
to control batch execution of pbdR scripts from R instead of the 
command line.  The primary purpose of this package is to aid attendees
of tutorials.

See the demos section for example usage.
